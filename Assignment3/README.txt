PYTHON SCRIPT:
The python script reads a novel in plain text format, 
normalizes the text by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation, 
and splits it into individual words. It then generates three output files: 
one containing all words in the novel, one containing words that appear 
exactly once, and one summarizing how many words occur at each frequency. 
These files are used as input for the visualizations in later parts of the assignment.

MONOGAME PROJECT:
When running the code, the first thing that will display is the word cloud. By left-clicking,
you can generate a new set of words with different colors. By pressing Enter, you will access
the display of WordFrequency, which is a nebula in our case.
