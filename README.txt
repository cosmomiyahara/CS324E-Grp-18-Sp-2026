This script reads a novel in plain text format, normalizes the text by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation, and splits it into individual words. It then generates three output files: one containing all words in the novel, one containing words that appear exactly once, and one summarizing how many words occur at each frequency. These files are used as input for the visualizations in later parts of the assignment.
